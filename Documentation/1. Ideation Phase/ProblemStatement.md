## Problem Statement

In the current fast-moving lifestyle, customers prefer quick and convenient services.  
Traditional food ordering methods such as visiting restaurants physically or ordering through phone calls have several limitations:

- Long waiting time  
- Miscommunication during phone orders  
- Limited visibility of menu details  
- Manual errors in order management  
- No proper tracking or confirmation system  

Restaurants also face issues such as:

- Managing multiple customer orders simultaneously  
- Tracking inventory manually  
- Maintaining customer records  
- Updating menu items efficiently

## Conclusion

Therefore, there is a need for a **centralized digital platform** that allows customers to place food orders easily while helping restaurants manage their operations effectively.
