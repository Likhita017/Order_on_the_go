## Three-Tier Architecture Explanation
The three-tier architecture divides the application into three logical layers:
1. **Presentation Layer**: The front-end interface for user interaction.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Processes commands, makes logical decisions and evaluations, and performs calculations.
3. **Data Layer**: Responsible for data storage, retrieval, and management.

Each layer is independent and facilitates scalability and maintainability by separating concerns.

## Data Flow Diagrams  
The data flow diagrams illustrate how data moves through the system, from input to output. Below is a basic representation of data flow:

- **Input**: User actions, system events
- **Process**: Business logic operations
- **Output**: Responses, data updates
