# Brainstorming

During brainstorming sessions, multiple potential solutions were discussed.  
The goal was to evaluate different approaches before selecting the final system architecture.

### Ideas Considered
1. **Mobile-only Application**
   - Android-based ordering system  
   - Limited cross-platform support  

2. **Web-based Application**
   - Accessible from any device with browser  
   - Easy to maintain and scalable  

3. **Hybrid Solution**
   - Web + Mobile integration  
   - Higher development complexity  

4. **Chatbot-based Ordering**
   - AI-based ordering via chatbot  
   - Requires advanced NLP integration
